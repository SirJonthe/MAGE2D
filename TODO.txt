Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)

IN PROGRESS
Kill line
	Game object
	Everything moving past this line is destroyed (in its OnCollision function)
Engine filtering of object list
	by ray - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by cone - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by box - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by sphere - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by separating plane - has to operate on collider, not transform position

DEBUG
Transforms
Font

WHEN DONE
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
while (vargrind warnings || compiler warnings) {
	Valgrind warnings
	Compiler warnings
}

BUGS
[FIXED?] Frame timer in Engine is wrong when delta time is less than 1, i.e. delay kicks in
Font crash
