TODO
mtlAsset::Purge
Fix Sprite class
	Gah! Can't animate sprite inside sprite class because
	mtlAsset makes Sprite const. Have to make a GraphicsInstance
	class and inherit that in a SpriteInstance class
Define and load a sprite format
Collisions
	Per pixel
	Box
	Polygon
	Circle
Physics?
	Roll my own?

LONG TERM PLANS
Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)
	Lers user view what assets are currently loaded into memory (as well as memory footprint)
Tile set editor
	Game object
	Place tiles + collision boxes in a grid
	Place objects on the grid
		This requires the editor to know what objects are available in the game

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410823/factory-method-implementation-c/534396#534396
		User must register them
Sprite editor:
	Game object that allows for editing sprites
	Load and save sprite files

IN PROGRESS
Kill line
	Game object
	Everything moving past this line is destroyed (in its OnCollision function)
Engine filtering of object list
	by ray - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by cone - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by box - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by sphere - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by separating plane - has to operate on collider, not transform position

DEBUG
Transforms

WHEN DONE
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
while (vargrind warnings || compiler warnings) {
	Valgrind warnings
	Compiler warnings
}

BUGS
mtlString::Append still not working
Pretty sure mtlArray::Resize not working as expected (will always allocate data as if pooling is disabled?)
