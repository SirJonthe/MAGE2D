--TODO--
--------
Transforms
	positions must be affected by parent transforms, but not its own transform
		how to I reverse these effects (for SetWorld* and SetParent)?
Collisions
	Box
	Polygon
	Circle
Physics?
	Roll my own?
		http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/custom-2d-physics-engine-oriented-rigid-bodies--gamedev-8032
	Remember:
		Physics act on transforms' World locations (not local locations)
More randomizer functions in engine
	Non linear randomizer
According to asset manager: "/home/jonathan/Code/SGE2D/Debug/test.bmp" is not same as relative file "test.bmp"
	Fix so that the engine detects absolute and relative files so that there is no risk of loading something twice
Define a safe way to reference objects inside engine
	mtlExclusive and mtlReference
	mtlReference required NULL check though

----------
--DESIGN--
----------
Type tree in Engine should be mtlStringMap instead of mtlBinaryTree (saves a ton of code)
In order for font to work properly I think I need to store font in an extended Graphics object
	Graphics objects store mirrors global state, font modifies global state which might desync Graphics mirrored state from global state

-------------------
--LONG TERM PLANS--
-------------------
Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)
	Lets user view what assets are currently loaded into memory (as well as memory footprint)
Tile set editor
	Game object
	Place tiles + collision boxes in a grid
	Place objects on the grid
		This requires the editor to know what objects are available in the game
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/582331/is-there-a-way-to-instantiate-objects-from-a-string-holding-their-class-name
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410823/factory-method-implementation-c/534396#534396
		User must register them
Sprite editor:
	Game object that allows for editing sprites
	Load and save sprite files

---------------
--IN PROGRESS--
---------------
Kill line
	Game object
	Everything moving past this line is destroyed (in its OnCollision function)
Engine filtering of object list
	by ray - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by cone - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by box - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by sphere - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by separating plane - has to operate on collider, not transform position

---------
--DEBUG--
---------
Transforms
	SetParent(0xffffffff, true)
		The position calculation is wrong since it takes no account for rotation

-------------
--WHEN DONE--
-------------
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
Valgrind warnings
Compiler warnings

--------
--BUGS--
--------
Valgrind is warning about a 4 byte overwrite in Object::Draw and Image does not render properly (must be something about triangle strip rendering)
mtlStringMap - Unit_StringMap
	Only adding first entry (CreateEntry)?
	Not finding other entries because only first entry is stored?
mtlString::Append still not working
Pretty sure mtlArray::Resize not working as expected (will always allocate data as if pooling is disabled?)
