--TODO--
--------
Collision response
	no physics, just prevent two objects from intersecting
Collisions
	Polygon

----------
--DESIGN--
----------
According to asset manager: "/home/jonathan/Code/SGE2D/Debug/test.bmp" is not same as relative file "test.bmp"
	Fix so that the engine detects absolute and relative files so that there is no risk of loading something twice
Type tree in Engine should be mtlStringMap instead of mtlBinaryTree (saves a ton of code)
In order for font to work properly I think I need to store font in an extended Graphics object
	Graphics objects store mirrors global state, font modifies global state which might desync Graphics mirrored state from global state

-------------------
--LONG TERM PLANS--
-------------------
Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)
	Lets user view what assets are currently loaded into memory (as well as memory footprint)
Tile set editor
	Game object
	Place tiles + collision boxes in a grid
	Place objects on the grid
		This requires the editor to know what objects are available in the game

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410823/factory-method-implementation-c/534396#534396
		User must register them
Sprite editor:
	Game object that allows for editing sprites
	Load and save sprite files
Physics?
	Roll my own?

	Remember:
		Physics act on transforms' World locations (not local locations)
More randomizer functions in engine
	Non linear randomizer

--DEBUG--
---------
Engine filtering methods

--WHEN DONE--
-------------
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
Valgrind warnings
Compiler warnings

--------
--BUGS--
--------
Valgrind is warning about a 4 byte overwrite in Object::Draw and Image does not render properly (must be something about triangle strip rendering)
mtlStringMap - Unit_StringMap
	Only adding first entry (CreateEntry)?
	Not finding other entries because only first entry is stored?
mtlString::Append still not working
Pretty sure mtlArray::Resize not working as expected (will always allocate data as if pooling is disabled?)
