Fix Sprite class
Define and load a sprite format
Collisions
	Per pixel
	Box
	Polygon
	Circle
Physics?
	Make room for box2d?
	Roll my own?

Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)

IN PROGRESS
Font
	Create a small surface that fits one character
	Render character to image
	Render image as textured quad (OpenGL)
Kill line
	Game object
	Everything moving past this line is destroyed (in its OnCollision function)
Camera class
Engine filtering of object list
	by ray - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by cone - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by box - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by sphere - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by separating plane - has to operate on collider, not transform position
Scaling and rotation, alpha/color key
	OpenGL rendering

DEBUG
Transforms

WHEN DONE
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
Valgrind
Warnings

BUGS
[FIXED?] Frame timer in Engine is wrong when delta time is less than 1, i.e. delay kicks in

ADDITIONAL
Avoid having the user needing to allocate memory manually.
	Data should not be able to be accideltally deleted by user that the engine is the sole master over.
Data structure that can reference an Object securely.
	Automatically references a NULL object if the Object it was originally referencing was deleted by the engine.
