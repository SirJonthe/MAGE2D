--TODO--
--------
Change name to MAGE2D (Minimal amateur game engine)
	https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository
Make SceneGraph (handles relations between transforms, that's all)
Simple GUI
Collision response
	no physics, just prevent two objects from intersecting
Object callbacks
mtlParser
	bool Match("%s = { %f, %f, %f };", mtlList<mtlString> &out);
	// a string (any)
	// an equals sign
	// an opening brace
	// three floats separated by commas
	// a closing brace
	// a semi-colon
	// NOTE: values will be returned in out
	// NOTE: can specify if white spaces should be ignored - may even search multiple kines of text
	// NOTE: returns FALSE if no match was found
	// NOTE: search always begins from current position forward (doesn't just look for match wherever it can find it)

--DESIGN--
----------
According to asset manager: "/home/jonathan/Code/SGE2D/Debug/test.bmp" is not same as relative file "test.bmp"
	Fix so that the engine detects absolute and relative files so that there is no risk of loading something twice
Type tree in Engine should be mtlStringMap instead of mtlBinaryTree (saves a ton of code)
In order for font to work properly I think I need to store font in an extended Graphics object
	Graphics objects store mirrors global state, font modifies global state which might desync Graphics mirrored state from global state

-------------------
--LONG TERM PLANS--
-------------------
Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)
	Lets user view what assets are currently loaded into memory (as well as memory footprint)
Tile set editor
	Game object
	Place tiles + collision boxes in a grid
	Place objects on the grid
Sprite editor:
	Game object that allows for editing sprites
	Load and save sprite files
Physics?
	Roll my own?

		http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/tutorial/collision_2d_perpixel_transformed
	Remember:
		Physics act on transforms' World locations (not local locations)
More randomizer functions in engine
	Non linear randomizer

Engine filtering methods

--WHEN DONE--
-------------
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
Valgrind warnings
Compiler warnings

--BUGS--
--------
Depending on the driver, font rendering is sometimes broken due to the fact that the characters are so closely packed
	On OSX, results in the top pixels of the characters directly below the rendered character to appear
	Fix by letting characters 'breathe', i.e. the UV coordinates are tightly packed around the character, but we increment UVs during construction by the actual character width
	<--> UV width
	####_###__
	#__#_#_#__
	####_####_
	#__#_#__#_
	#__#_####_
	<----> actual width

Valgrind is warning about a 4 byte overwrite in Object::Draw and Image does not render properly (must be something about triangle strip rendering)
mtlStringMap - Unit_StringMap
	Only adding first entry (CreateEntry)?
	Not finding other entries because only first entry is stored?
mtlString::Append still not working
Pretty sure mtlArray::Resize not working as expected (will always allocate data as if pooling is disabled?)
