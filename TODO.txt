--TODO--
--------
Fix Sprite class
Define and load a sprite format
Collisions
	Per pixel
	Box
	Polygon
	Circle
Physics?
	Roll my own?

More randomizer functions in engine
	Own random function
	Floating point [0.0,1.0) (goes from 0 but never reaches 1)
	Non linear randomizer

----------
--DESIGN--
----------
Type tree in Engine should be mtlStringMap instead of mtlBinaryTree (saves a ton of code)
In order for font to work properly I think I need to store font in an extended Graphics object
	Graphics objects store mirrors global state, font modifies global state which might desync Graphics mirrored state from global state

-------------------
--LONG TERM PLANS--
-------------------
Debugger:
	Game object that stops time
	Lets user click on an object and view its properties
	Requires objects to implement an output function (that prints values)
	Lets user view what assets are currently loaded into memory (as well as memory footprint)
Tile set editor
	Game object
	Place tiles + collision boxes in a grid
	Place objects on the grid
		This requires the editor to know what objects are available in the game

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410823/factory-method-implementation-c/534396#534396
		User must register them
Sprite editor:
	Game object that allows for editing sprites
	Load and save sprite files

---------------
--IN PROGRESS--
---------------
Kill line
	Game object
	Everything moving past this line is destroyed (in its OnCollision function)
Engine filtering of object list
	by ray - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by cone - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by box - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by sphere - has to operate on collider, not transform position
	by separating plane - has to operate on collider, not transform position

--DEBUG--
---------
Transforms

--WHEN DONE--
-------------
MiniLib
	Update MiniLib components?
	Link to MiniLib on GitHub somehow?
		git submodules
Valgrind warnings
Compiler warnings

--------
--BUGS--
--------
mtlString::Append still not working
Pretty sure mtlArray::Resize not working as expected (will always allocate data as if pooling is disabled?)

--ADDITIONAL--
